Python SDK for CloudPassage Halo API

Installation
------------

.. image:: https://badge.fury.io/py/cloudpassage.svg
    :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cloudpassage/

Requirements:

* requests
* pyaml


Install from pip with ``pip install cloudpassage``.  If you want to make
modifications to the SDK you can install it in editable mode by downloading
the source from this github repo, navigating to the top directory within the
archive and running ``pip install -e .`` (note the . at the end).

Quick Start
-----------

Here's the premise: you store your session configuration information (API
credentials, proxy settings, etc) in the cloudpassage.HaloSession object.
This object gets passed into the various class methods which allow you
to interact with the CloudPassage Halo API.

Practical example:
We'll print a list of all servers in our account:

::

    import cloudpassage

    api_key = MY_HALO_API_KEY
    api_secret = MY_API_SECRET
    session = cloudpassage.HaloSession(api_key, api_secret)
    server = cloudpassage.Server(session)

    list_of_servers = server.list_all()
    for s in list_of_servers:
        print "ID: %s   Name: %s" % (s["id"], s["hostname"])
